### Jason Kim

Hello! I am currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon working with the Alexa Routines Team. In 2023, I graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. As a student, I built a vast array of projects ranging from compilers and operating systems to web applications. As an engineer, I primarily focus on writing robust services that can handle a wide variety of data in a secure and efficient manner. In addition, I design projects meant to provide customers with an accesible, reliable, and transparent experience.
