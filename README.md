### Jason Kim

I am currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon working with the Alexa Routines Team. In 2023, I graduated from Boston University with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering. As a student and engineer, I have built a vast array of projects ranging from compilers and operating systems to web applications.
