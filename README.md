### Jason Kim

I am a student at Boston University in pursuit of a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. My technical abilities range from frontend with frameworks such as React and Vue to backend with technologies such as Firebase, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am also proficient in Python, Javascript, and Java which I have taught as a mentor in the past.

Last Summer, I was a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon working on projects with the Alexa Skill Connections Team.
