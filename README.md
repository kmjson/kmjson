### Jason Kim

Hello! I am currently a Software Development Engineer at Amazon working with the Alexa Routines Team. In 2023, I graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. As a student, I built a vast array of projects ranging from compilers and operating systems to web applications. As an engineer, I primarily focus on creating robust applications that can handle a wide variety of data while also helping my team architect and design future projects.
